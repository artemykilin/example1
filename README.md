This is a test application I did for one company.

This application downloads images from the pixabay service and shows thumbnails as a list. User may tap an image record to see the image itself and details.

Request result are stored locally in sqlite database for some time and the request is performed only if there is no locally stored result.  

To make the app working you need to generate your own pixabay api key and add it in app/build.gradle
